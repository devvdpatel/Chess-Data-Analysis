The dataset includes the raw game files (pgn) and a tabular version of all the games in the archive. Coverage includes games from 2012-2022.

During the analysis, I attempted to: 
  1. Look at the general trends from the archive of games.
  2. Review top pairings and players.
  3. Use the chess python package to review a game
  4. Use the stockfish engine to analyze a game position
  5. See if we can successfully catch someone who might be using an engine during games.
